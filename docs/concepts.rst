The Restaurant Analogy
----------------------

*Parasect* employs a **restaurant analogy** to encode its functionality.

When you interact with *Parasect*, you define a **Menu of Meals** that *Parasect* can prepare for you.

The Menu contains multiple **Meals**. Each Meal represents a distinct parameter set,
a configuration that should be unique and reflect a unique unmanned vehicle.
The Menu is defined in the ``meals.yaml`` file where each Meal is named and represented by a dictionary.

*Example* ``meals.yaml`` *file:*

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/assets/px4/menu/meals.yaml
   :language: yaml

The Meal is made up of **Dishes**. Each Dish represents a notional subset of the autopilot's parameters, which makes it
easier to define and manage.
In this case ``light_meal`` contains the Dishes ``dish_1``, ``dish_2``, ``header`` and ``footer``.

Each Dish contains a **common** **Recipe**, which specifies which **Ingredients** make up the Dish, as well as a list
of **Allergens** that should not exist in the Dish.

Furthermore, one or more Dish **Variants** can be specified in the Dish file, which are specializations of the common Recipe.
They define more Ingredients and more Allergens. The Variants can be infinitely nested.

In the Meal dictionary, the Dish names are defined in the dictionary key, while the dictionary value specifies the Dish
**Variant** that should be used for that meal.
If no Variant is specified (the value is set to ``~``, i.e. ``None``) then the ``common`` Recipe is used.
On the contrary, a value of ``variant_1/subvariant_a`` signifies that the Meals needs to be specialized with Variant Recipes.

*Example Dish file:*

TODO

The user is free to create as many Custom Dishes he wants under the ``custom_dishes`` folder and then refer to them
in ``meals.yaml``. Not all Meals need to refer to all available Dishes.
However, there are Staple Dishes that serve special purposes and are defined in the ``staple_dishes`` folder;
their filenames are significant and should not be altered. Still the user is expected to fill in their content.

Such Dishes are:

* ``calibration.yaml``: The calibration parameters can be defined there.
* ``operator.yaml``: The operator parameters can be defined there.
* ``header.yaml``: The header text of the generated parameter files can be defined there.
* ``footer.yaml``: The footer text of the generated parameter files can be defined there.

*Menu Folder Structure:*

Functional Requirements
-----------------------

*Parasect* builds parameter sets while satisfying and enforcing these requirements:

1. If a *Default Parameters* set is provided, it will form the basis of the Meal.
   These default parameters are often autogenerated by the autopilot toolchain.
   It is highly recommended to build upon a default parameters set, because you can thus enforce the default value
   in all of the parameters you don't wish to alter.
2. The Ingredients of all the Dishes will set custom values to the Meal.
   If you provide a default parameters set, it is an illegal operation to set an Ingredient that doesn't exist in it.
   This is to catch spelling mistakes in the parameter names.
3. The Variant Recipes should not re-define an Ingredient that their parent Common Recipe already defined.
   This is to make it easier to trace which part of the Dish file ends up in the Meal.
4. The Ingredients in the Calibration Dish are removed from the Meal.
5. The Ingredients in the Operator Dish are removed from the Meal.
